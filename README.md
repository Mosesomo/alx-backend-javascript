ES6 Basics
----------------------------------------
ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, which is the specification that JavaScript is based on. ES6 brought significant improvements and new features to the language. Some key features introduced in ES6 include:

1.let and const Declarations: ES6 introduced let and const for variable declarations, providing block-scoped variables and constants, respectively.
2.Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for defining functions, especially for one-liners.

3.Template Literals: Template literals allow for more flexible string interpolation and multiline strings.
