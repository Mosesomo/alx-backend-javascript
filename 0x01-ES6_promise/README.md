Promises
------------------------------------
In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It is a way to handle asynchronous operations more easily and avoid callback hell (nested callbacks).

A Promise can be in one of three states:

Pending: The initial state. The promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected. It's still in progress.

Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.

Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.
