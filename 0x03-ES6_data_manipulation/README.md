ES6 Data manipulation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced several features that facilitate data manipulation in JavaScript. Here are some key features related to data manipulation in ES6:

Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions. They are useful for short and anonymous functions, making code more readable.

Template Literals:
Template literals allow for more flexible and readable string interpolation. They use backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.
